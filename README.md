# Motion Detection with OpenCV (not completed)

This project demonstrates a basic motion detection system using OpenCV in Python. 
It captures live video feed from the system's camera, detects motion using background subtraction, and logs the motion events.

## Features
- Captures video from the system's default camera.
- Detects motion using `cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()`.
- Displays the live camera feed along with the motion-detected foreground.
- Logs motion events into a text file.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have Python 
and 
the required packages installed.

### Python Version
- Python 3.x

### Packages
- OpenCV

## To install OpenCV, use the following command:
- pip install opencv-python

## Running the Project
- Clone this repository or copy the code to your local system.
- Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
- Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Python script:
    python motion_detector.py


## Usage
The script will open two windows:
- Original: Displays the live camera feed.
- Foreground: Shows the detected motion using background subtraction.
Press the ESC key to stop the program and close the windows.
